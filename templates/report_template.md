# BLDC Motor Eccentricity and Control Study: {motor_id}

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of the `{motor_id}` brushless DC (BLDC) motor. The primary objective is to quantify the impact of geometric manufacturing imperfections (static/dynamic eccentricity, rotor tilt) on motor performance, specifically torque ripple. Additionally, the performance of Field-Oriented Control (FOC) and Six-Step control strategies were evaluated under various operating conditions.

**Motor Key Specifications:**
- **Poles:** {poles}
- **Nominal Torque:** {torque_nom_Nm} Nm
- **Torque Constant (kT):** {kT_Nm_per_A} Nm/A
- **Stator OD:** {stator_OD_mm} mm
- **Rotor ID:** {rotor_ID_mm} mm


## 2. Finite Element Analysis (FEMM)

FEMM simulations were conducted to model the motor's magnetostatic properties. A parametric sweep was performed across a range of geometric errors to generate torque maps as a function of mechanical angle.

### 2.1. Torque Ripple Analysis

The torque ripple, defined as `(T_max - T_min) / T_avg`, was calculated for each combination of geometric errors. The results are summarized below.

## 3. System-Level Simulation (OpenModelica)

The torque maps generated from FEMM were used in a system-level OpenModelica model to simulate the motor's dynamic response. The model includes the motor, a configurable inverter/controller, a digital encoder, and a mechanical load.

### 3.1. Control Response

Simulations were run for both FOC and Six-Step controllers at different speeds and HIL sampling frequencies. The following plots show the system's response for a representative case.

### 3.2. Campbell Diagram Analysis (Placeholder)

A Campbell diagram is essential for identifying potential resonance issues by plotting the frequency content of system variables (like torque or UMP) against the motor's rotational speed.

*(Note: Generating a full Campbell diagram requires dedicated run-up simulations and advanced post-processing, which is planned for future work.)*
